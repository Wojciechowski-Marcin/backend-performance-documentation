\section{Database}

For the tests, a database consisting of a single table was created - a model is presented in a table \ref{tab:dbModel}.

\input{tables/databaseModel.tex}

For every application the operations on the PostgreSQL database may be slightly different, since in Django and ASP.NET they are handled by the Object-Relational Mapping libraries, while Express works on sql statements.

\subsection{Database connection and initiation}

Django handles a lot of things for the user - connection is very simple - in initial project generation a file settings.py is created, which consists of all the necessary variables for the system to work. In the file we can find a variable named Databases, initially with sqlite backend. All that needs to be done to connect to our PostgreSQL is to change the engine to built-in PG backend and change the remaining fields - name, user, password, host and port. With that done, the connection is automatically done on the system startup.
