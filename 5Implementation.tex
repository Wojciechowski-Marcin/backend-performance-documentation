\subsection{Database connection and initiation}

Django handles a lot of things for the user - connection is very simple - in initial project generation a file settings.py is created, which consists of all the necessary variables for the system to work. In the file we can find a variable named Databases, initially with SQLite backend. All that needs to be done to connect to our PostgreSQL is to change the engine to built-in \acrshort{pg} backend and change the remaining fields - name, user, password, host and port. With that done, the connection is automatically done on the system startup.
